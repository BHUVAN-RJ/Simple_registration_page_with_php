While creating Database in phpmyadmin make sure that all the Feilds are VARCHAR Except Phone which is BIGINT<br/>

Set your DB name, user and password accordingly.

Also you can change the html page and add more feilds , styles and more pages as well. While doing so make sure to make corresponding changes to php file as well.
